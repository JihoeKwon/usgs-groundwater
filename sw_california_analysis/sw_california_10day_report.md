## 3. Kriging Interpolation Results

### Interpolated Surface Statistics

- **Interpolated Depth Range**: 10.6 ft ~ 555.7 ft
- **Mean Interpolated Depth**: 142.9 ft
- **Total Frames**: 110

### Yearly Summary (Kriging Results)

| Year | Frames | Avg Min (ft) | Avg Max (ft) | Avg Mean (ft) |
|------|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2023 | 37 | 17.6 | 549.4 | 154.0 |
| 2024 | 37 | 16.0 | 535.0 | 145.3 |
| 2025 | 36 | 16.7 | 508.4 | 129.0 |

## 4. Spatial Patterns

Based on the kriging interpolation results:

- **Deep Aquifer Zone**: Areas with depth > 400 ft (typically in mountainous/inland regions)
- **Shallow Aquifer Zone**: Areas with depth < 100 ft (typically near coast/valleys)
- **Transition Zone**: Areas with depth 100-400 ft

## 5. Data Quality Warnings

> **CAUTION**: The following data quality issues were detected:

- Site count dropped 36% from peak (69 sites on 2023-02-10) to 44 sites on 2025-12-26

These issues may significantly affect the reliability of trend analysis and kriging results.
Results for periods with reduced site counts should be interpreted with caution.

## 6. Trend Analysis

- **Early Period Mean** (2023-01-01 ~ 2023-04-01): 157.6 ft
- **Late Period Mean** (2025-09-27 ~ 2025-12-26): 107.4 ft
- **Change**: -50.2 ft (rising)

> **Note**: This trend may be affected by the significant reduction in monitoring sites 
> during the late period. The apparent change could be due to:
> - Actual groundwater level changes
> - Sampling bias from site dropout (remaining sites may not be representative)
> - Seasonal data collection patterns
